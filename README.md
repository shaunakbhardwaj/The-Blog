# The-Blog
This is a basic blog/journal website. Made using Node, Express, EJS, CSS and Bootstrap.

This website displays posts that already exist and allows the user (me) to compose new posts using.
Posts that are longer than 100 characters will have a "Read more" button which will lead the user to a page where they can read the full post.
