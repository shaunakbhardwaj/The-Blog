# The-Blog
This is a basic blog/journal website. Made using Node, Express, EJS, CSS and Bootstrap. 

What can it do?
This website displays posts that already exist and allows the user (me) to compose new posts.
Posts that are longer than 100 characters will have a "Read more" button which will lead the user to a page where they can read the full post.
